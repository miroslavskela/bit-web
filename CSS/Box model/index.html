    <p class="one onedynamic">Portuguese people are a ethnic group indigenous to Portugal that share a common Portuguese culture and speak Portuguese
        as a primary language. Their predominant religion is Christianity, mainly Roman Catholicism. Historically the Portuguese
        people's heritage includes the pre-Celts, Celts (Celtiberians, Lusitanians, Gallaecians and Celtici) the Romans,
        Greeks, Scandinavians, and migratory Germanic tribes like the Vandals, Visigoths (Western Goths) and Suebi. The Roman
        Republic conquered the Iberian Peninsula during the 2nd and 1st centuries B.C. from the extensive maritime empire
        of Carthage during the series of Punic Wars. As a result of Roman colonization, the majority of local languages stem
        from the Vulgar Latin. Due to the large historical extent from the 16th century of the Portuguese Empire and the
        subsequent colonization of territories in Asia, Africa and the Americas, as well as historical and recent emigration,
        Portuguese communities can be found in many diverse regions around the globe, and a large Portuguese diaspora exists.
        Portuguese people were a key factor to the Age of Exploration beginning at the end of the 15th century and extending
        into the 16th, 17th, 18th centuries and consolidated during the 19th century. Discovering during these times, several
        lands unknown to the Europeans in the Americas, Africa, Asia and Oceania (southwest Pacific Ocean), helping to pave
        the way for the globalization and dominazation of Western civilization. Today, Portugal also exhibits a multicultural
        society from around the world, but in particular from its former most recent colonies of the Lusosphere, such as
        Brazilians, Cape Verdeans, Angolans, Mozambicans, Goans, Macanese and Timorese people.</p>

    <p class="two twodynamic">The Lusitanians (or LusitƒÅnus/Lusitani in Latin) were an Indo-European speaking people (likely Celtic) living in the
        Western Iberian Peninsula long before it became the Roman province of Lusitania (modern Portugal, Extremadura and
        a small part of Salamanca). They spoke the Lusitanian language, of which only a few short written fragments survive.
        Most Portuguese consider the Lusitanians as their ancestors. Although the northern regions (Minho, Douro, Tras-os-Montes)
        identify more with the Gallaecians. It has been hypothesized that the Lusitanians may have originated in the Alps
        and settled in the region in the 6th century BC. Some modern scholars consider them to be indigenous and initially
        dominated by the Celts, before gaining full independence from them. The archaeologist Scarlat Lambrino proposed that
        they were originally a tribal Celtic group, related to the Lusones. The first area settled by the Lusitanians was
        probably the Douro valley and the region of Beira Alta; then they moved south, and expanded on both sides of the
        Tagus river, before being conquered by the Romans. The original Roman province of Lusitania was extended north of
        the areas occupied by the Lusitanians to include the territories of Asturias and Gallaecia but these were soon ceded
        to the jurisdiction of the Provincia Tarraconensis in the north, while the south remained the Provincia Lusitania
        et Vettones. After this, Lusitania's northern border was along the Douro river, while its eastern border passed through
        Salmantica and Caesarobriga to the Anas (Guadiana) river.</p>
